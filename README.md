<p align="center"><i>lightweight ASGI framework</i> </p>

## Nymph

Nymph is an asynchronous web framework (currently under development). Learn more about <a href="https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">ASGI</a>.  
This is not ready for production however you can try it out.

**Features**  

- Decorator routing and class based router for sub applications
- Cookie support
- Template responses using <a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/">Jinja2</a>
- Static file responses

## Requirements

Python 3.6+

## Setup

```bash
pip3 install nymph
```

> or just clone this and use directly to get the latest development version.

You'll also want to install an ASGI server, such as uvicorn.

```bash
pip3 install uvicorn
```

## Example

**example.py**
```python
from nymph import Nymph
from nymph.responses import PlainTextResponse

app = Nymph()

@app.route("/")
async def index(req):
    response = PlainTextResponse(content="Hello World")
    return response
```

Then run using uvicorn:

```bash
uvicorn example:app
```

## FYI

1. Can I use this for my projects?
    - No. Not at this point because it is still under development and there are so many things left to be done/improved. Besides, there is no test coverage yet.
    - You can see the list of things I planned to work in the near future at the bottom.

2. Is this just another web framework?
    - I started this to learn how a framework like <a href="https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/" target="_blank">Flask</a> actually works and I am also interested in ASGI, so I decided to build this in ASGI instead of WSGI. However, after I used <a href="https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/" target="_blank">Flask</a> and <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com" target="_blank">Django</a> for a long time, I found things that I love and hate from each. So when I started working on this, I made it to include good features that both of those have (I.e. `individual small applications` feature from Django).
